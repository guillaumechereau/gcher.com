[Goxel] is a new project I have been working on since last month.  It's an open
source 3D editor to create voxel images (in the style of minecraft, or crossy
road).

It works on Linux and Windows.

# Features:

- 24 bits RGB colors.
- Unlimited scene size.
- Unlimited undo buffer.
- Layers.
- Smooth rendering mode.
- Export to obj and pyl.
