This is the first post on my new blog.  I decided to stop using blogspot
([here][charlie137-2] is a link to my previous blog) for a few reasons:

- Blogspot does not allow to write the posts in a markup language like
  [markdown] or [reStructuredText][rst].  Instead you have to use either the
  "user friendly" interface that seems to never render things the way you want
  to, or directly type the post in html.

- Blogspot has no support for showing code.  I guess most bloggers don't really
  need that, but I do.  Until now I used [highlight.js][hjs] that did the job
  quite well, but forced me to remember to use the proper html tags in my
  posts.  Not an optimal solution.

- I want to keep a local copy of my blog on my computer, and a backup on a
  server using a version control system.

- Finally, I wanted to write my own blog engine, for the fun of it.


The code of this blog is very minimalist.  I wrote the whole thing in 400 lines
of python, using [webpy], [jinja2], and [bootstrap].  If some people show
interest to get the source code I will happily release it under a free licence.

2017-03-15 Update: Today I decided to use jekyll instead, as it does everything
my code was doing and more.  You can probably use the internet time
machine to find the original look of this blog.
