Just a small post to announce the release of my new video game: [Blowfish
Rescue].

This is a 2d action/puzzle game using a fluid simulation solver.  Most of the
graphics are procedurally generated.

The game is available for free on [google play] and [iTune].

Here is a promo video I did:

In the following week I will open source the procedural generation code, as I
think this is an interesting part of the code, and can probably be reused for
other games.  Stay tuned.
