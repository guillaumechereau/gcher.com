I just released the version 0.3.0 of my open source voxel editor [Goxel].

This release brings:

- Import/Export support for the popular editor [Magica Voxel].
- Render shadows.
- Better shapes support, specially when we use marching cube rendering.
- Multiple palettes.
- Better UI, with new tools icons.

Here is a video of the laser tool:
